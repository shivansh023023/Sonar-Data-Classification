# Sonar Data Classification: Rock vs. Mine

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow to classify sonar signals as either a "Rock" or a "Mine". It utilizes a Logistic Regression model trained on the provided sonar data.

## Project Overview

As an interviewer, I'd be interested in seeing how you approach a binary classification problem from data loading to model evaluation. This project clearly showcases these fundamental steps.

The key components of this project are:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loading the dataset and understanding its structure and basic statistics.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for the machine learning model, including separating features and the target variable.
3.  **Model Training**: Training a Logistic Regression model on the prepared data.
4.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using accuracy scores on both training and test datasets.
5.  **Prediction System**: Building a simple system to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Implementation Details

Here's a breakdown of the implementation steps:

*   **Libraries Used**: The project leverages popular Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning: `numpy`, `pandas`, and `sklearn`.
*   **Data Loading**: The `sonar_data.csv` file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The `header=None` argument is used as the dataset does not contain a header row.
*   **Data Exploration**: Basic data exploration is performed using `head()`, `shape`, `describe()`, and `value_counts()` to understand the data structure, dimensions, statistical summary, and the distribution of the target variable.
*   **Data Preparation**: The data is split into features (`X`) and the target variable (`Y`). The target variable, originally strings ('M' and 'R'), is suitable for use with `LogisticRegression` in `sklearn`.
*   **Splitting Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`. A `test_size` of 0.1 is used, and `stratify=Y` ensures that the proportion of 'Rock' and 'Mine' samples is maintained in both the training and testing sets. `random_state` is set for reproducibility.
*   **Model Selection and Training**: A `LogisticRegression` model is instantiated and trained on the training data (`X_train`, `Y_train`) using the `fit()` method. Logistic Regression is a suitable choice for this binary classification task and is a good starting point for understanding classification concepts.
*   **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated by calculating the accuracy score on both the training and testing datasets. The accuracy score on the training data indicates how well the model learned the training examples, while the accuracy on the test data provides an estimate of how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data.
*   **Prediction**: A simple prediction system is built to demonstrate how the trained model can be used to classify a new input data point. The input data is converted to a numpy array and reshaped to match the input requirements of the `predict()` method.

## How to Run the Code

1.  Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`.
2.  Make sure the `sonar_data.csv` file is in the correct path or update the path in the code.
3.  Run the code cells sequentially in a Jupyter Notebook or Colab environment.

## Potential Improvements and Future Work

*   **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data to gain further insights into the relationships between features and the target variable.
*   **Feature Scaling**: Explore feature scaling techniques (e.g., Standardization or Normalization) which can sometimes improve the performance of Logistic Regression.
*   **Other Models**: Experiment with other classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), or Random Forests to compare their performance.
*   **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model to potentially improve accuracy.
*   **More Detailed Evaluation Metrics**: Explore other evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix, to get a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding binary classification. By exploring the suggested improvements, you can further enhance your understanding and build more sophisticated models.
